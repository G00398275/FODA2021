This repository exists as part of the assessment of the "Fundamentals of Data Analysis" module for the Higher Diploma in Computer Science in Data Analytics.  
The repository contains two Jupyter notebooks, pyplot.ipynb and cao.ipynb. Pyplot.ipynb provides an overview of the matplotlib.pyplot package in Python. Cao.ipynb is a notebook which loads the points from the CAO website and examines the differences between the years 2019 / 2020 / 2021 using pandas and plots. More details have been included below.  
A requirements.txt file has also been added to run the notebooks with minimal configuration.
